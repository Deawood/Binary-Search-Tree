# Binary-Search-Tree

I created this Binary Search Tree (BST) for a Data Structures class I took.
This program is designed to store items in such a way to allow fast addition, removal and lookup of
items in it.

To compile this program in mac terminal use "clang++ -std=c++14 -o bst BST.cpp" 
Then enter "./bst < Name-of-maze-text-file-here.txt"
