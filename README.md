# Binary-Search-Tree

I developed a program that produces the word to be placed in the root of a binary search tree, which is optimal relative to the words and search frequencies given as input.

To compile this program in mac terminal use "clang++ -std=c++14 -o bst BST.cpp" 
Then enter "./bst < Name-of-input-file.txt"
